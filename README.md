# LockTalk

**LockTalk** is a simple yet effective encryption-based communication system where users can choose between two different encryption techniques for securing their messages. The system allows both the client and server to exchange encrypted data using **Caesar Cipher** and **XOR Cipher** methods, ensuring data privacy and integrity.

The project consists of two parts:
- **Client**: A program that connects to the server, sends encrypted data, and displays the decrypted response.
- **Server**: A server that handles client connections, performs encryption (Caesar or XOR), and sends the encrypted data back to the client.

## Overview

**LockTalk** is designed for educational purposes to demonstrate encryption and decryption mechanisms, allowing users to interact with two common encryption techniques:
1. **Caesar Cipher**: A substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a certain number of places down the alphabet.
2. **XOR Cipher**: A bitwise operation encryption method that applies an XOR operator to each character in the input string using a key.

Users can enter a message, select the encryption method, and the server will return the encrypted data. The client can then decrypt the message using the same method.

## Features

- **Caesar Cipher**: Encrypt and decrypt messages using a shifting key.
- **XOR Cipher**: Encrypt and decrypt messages using an XOR key.
- **Client-Server Communication**: The client connects to the server, sends encrypted data, and receives the decrypted result.
- **Dynamic Encryption Key**: The server automatically determines the encryption key based on character frequency or generates random keys.
- **Interactive Menu**: Both client and server provide simple menus for users to select encryption types and input their messages.
- **Data Privacy**: Encrypts data to ensure secure communication between the client and the server.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Encryption Techniques**: Caesar Cipher, XOR Cipher
